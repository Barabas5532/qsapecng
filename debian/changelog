qsapecng (2.0.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed "FTBFS: obsolete build dependency libqwt5-qt4-dev". Removed from
    debian/control obsolete libqwt5-qt4-dev dependency. (Closes: #638365)
  * Fixed the lintian warning "embedded-javascript-library" due to the file
    jquery.js previously included in the qsapecng-doc package. That file has
    been substituted with a symlink to the file installed with the package
    libjs-jquery.
  * Added libjs-jquery as a dependency for the qsapecng-doc package.
