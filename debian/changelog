qsapecng (2.0.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Updated debian/control:
     - changed Standards-Version to 3.9.2.
     - changed Build-Depends for Qwt libraries: libqwt5-qt4-dev | libqwt-dev.
     - changed Description to reflect the original one in the upstream README.
  * Removed unneeded compile flags (compile_flags.patch): debug symbols were
    always added to the final binaries even in the 'Release' target.
  * Solved incompatibility with Qwt version 6 (libqwt6_fix.patch).
