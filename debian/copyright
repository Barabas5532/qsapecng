      Hello, I'm packaging for Debian the software QSapecNG
      http://qsapecng.sourceforge.net/ which uses your rpoly.cpp file. The
      software cannot be put on Debian's main repository because your file has
      no license information in the header.
 .
      On your website I found that "All downloadable software is offered freely
      and without restriction". I'm writing you to ask if you can add a
      sentence like that ("This software is offered freely...") to the header
      of rpoly.cpp file (which put that file under Public Domain) or if you can
      release that file under a GPL-compatible license
      http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#GPLCompatibleLicenses
      adding to the header the proper notice.
 .
 .
      Thank you very much, best regards
      Simone

      Hi Simone,
 .
      Thanks for your interest in rpoly.cpp.
 .
      I have placed rpoly.cpp completely in
      the public domain. That means there are
      no restrictions whatsoever in its use
      by others. You may use or modify it in
      any way that suits your purposes. I do
      not require any citations or acknowledgmentsI
      It may also be repackaged or bundled
      with other software. 
 .
      If any bugs or performance problems are
      discovered, I will try to correct them,
      so please notify me if any are found.
 .
      Some of the software on my website carry
      weak copyright notices, but they are
      only there to limit proliferation during
      early, debug stages of development.
 .
      Best regards and good luck,
 .
      C. R. Bond, crb@crbond.com

      P.S. These permissions for unrestricted
      use allow you to place any notices of
      your choice into the versions of rpoly.cpp
      that you distribute.
