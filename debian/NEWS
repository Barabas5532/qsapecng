qsapecng (2.0.0beta1-1) unstable; urgency=low

    This new release has the full support for sub-circuits that can now be
    created, saved, reopened and added as part of other circuits. This
    functionality offers great flexibility for large and complex circuits,
    in particular when a small portion of the circuit is repeated many times:
    the small portion can be created and saved as a stand-alone circuit and
    then added wherever needed in the bigger circuit.
