- IMPORTANTE: port come oggetti a sé stile wire anziché component?

- refactoring:
    introdurre progetti
    eliminare workspace
    risultati in messages
- traduzione in italiano (lupdate e compagnia)

- scrivere la sezione "Usage" sia nel README che in debian/qsapecng.1
- avvio da riga di comando passando il file circuito in ingresso.
- leggere per i tipi MIME
    o http://www.debian.org/doc/packaging-manuals/mime-policy/
    o http://wiki.debian.org/MimeTypesSupport
    o http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30931/register-file-extensions-mime-types-in-linux
- mantenendo la stessa icona, rederla più usabile su ambienti desktop

- replotting nel workplane in thread separato o blocca tutto!! :-)

- Application asked to unregister timer 0x34000004 which is not registered in this thread. Fix application.
  Errore quando si passa al workplane... :-(

- closeEvent in qsapecngwindow non torna mica tanto! :-D

- J.C.: Matlab function output
- J.C.: output like 10k, 1p, etc.
- J.C.: polarity on Ammeter / Voltmeter
- J.C.: Approximate solution (vedi Luchetta e SapWin)


-------------------------------- REQUEST
Dear Dr. Caini,
 
I've been wanting to move to a more-modern symbolic analysis program than Sapwin.  I had thought that QSapec-NG would do what I want, but there is a problem I've encountered that makes it impossible for me to use for practical circuits:  component values can only range from 0.01 to 10000000. 

There are two issues there:
1.  Scientific notation is generally used in electronics, and specifically,
2.  Values for capacitors, in general, are much less than 0.01Farads.  Unless there is an option for setting the basic unit (for example, to picoFarads, nanoFarads, or microFarads which I have missed, this means that all problems will need to be manually scaled.
 
Sapwin accepts scientific notation, which avoids all scaling problems with component value entry.
 
Did I miss some option setting?  If not, are there plans to change the value entry code?
 
Thank you for your work - symbolic analysis is not wildly popular, and so I appreciate your efforts in this area, and your willingness to use the Open Source method of distribution.
 
Regards,
#### ########
